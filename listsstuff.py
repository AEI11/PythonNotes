# 1. Create a new list named double_nums by multiplying each number in nums by two.
nums = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]


# 2. Youâ€™ve been given a list of the numbers between 0 and 10. 
# We created this list using the range function! 
# Create a new list named squares that contains the square of every number in this list.
nums = range(11)

# 3. Create a new list named add_ten that adds ten to every element in the list nums.
nums = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

# 4. Create a new list named divide_by_two that contains half of every element in the list nums. 
# Make sure to divide by 2, not 2.0!
nums = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

# 5. Create a new list named parity that contains a 1 or a 0 for each element of nums. 
# For each element, if that element was even, the new list should contain a 0. 
# If the element was odd, the new list should contain a 1.
# HINT: You can use %2 to determine if a number is even or odd. 
# If it is even, there should be no remainder (an output of 0). 
# If it is odd, there should be a remainder of 1:

nums = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

#Create a new list named greetings that adds "Hello, " in front of each name in the list names.
names = ["Elaine", "George", "Jerry", "Cosmo"]

#Create a new list named first_character that contains the first character from every name in the list names
